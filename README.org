* Overview
  This personal init.el and other *.el files maintained by myself
  Till now, I divided init.el into 3 parts: 
  - init.el :: does the main init works
  - coding-conf.el :: configure all my coding modes
  - emlib.el :: separates the function from configure file make them configure file easier to read and less mistakes made 

* ATTETION
  - this is NOT a bundle, and is not maintained as ready to be used out of box

* FIXME:
  - I use it seems autopair remap the RET key which makes auto-complete( type RET and make the completion ) in-operate. Make a universial RET dwim function
  - ibus-el is NOT maintained by el-get(and wasn't included in the repository), since a building process error

* TODO config:
  CEDET
  orgmode
